    (Click the import button and drag the file to the top section of the
    import dialog box).

    the "Read Random Line" sub-action to point to the folder you put
    "WelcomeMessages.txt".
 5. There are comments in the sub-actions panel showing you how to set
    up a simple system to ignore you and your bots, as well as how to
    set up auto-shoutouts.

    General, set the First Words to be the Welcome action.
